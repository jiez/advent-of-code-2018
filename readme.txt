I was finishing my first read of the Rust book and looking for something to
practice it. One of my colleagues introduced me to Advent of Code 2018.
It sounded a lot of fun. So why not use it for practicing Rust?

These solutions were my first programs in Rust.

I believe all of them have much room to improve. Some solutions still have bugs
although they gave the correct answer. Most of the code need to be cleaned up.

My plan is to improve these solutions while I'm gaining more and more Rust power.
